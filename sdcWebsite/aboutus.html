        <h3 class="post-title">Bowman Brown</h3>
        <p>Bowman was born and raised in Miami, Fl. and is an avid swimmer and diver. He loves to write code, and is hoping to use his expertise to advance his two principal interests - artificial intelligence and machine learning.</p>

        <h3 class="post-title">Tao Liu</h3>
        <p>Tao was born and grew up in China. He came to Carleton in 2013 as an international student and has been studying Computer Science as his major. After graduation, he will go to Silicon Valley to continue his dream of building great products at mass-scale. His vision for the self-driving car is that in ten years, cars probably won't be able to drive autonomously, but the advanced driver assistance system that even luxury cars don't have today will be mass-produced for ordinary cars. Just think of the smart phone industry in the last ten years and you will get a sense.</p>

        <p>Kiet Tran grew up in Taiwan and went to Carleton College studying as a CS major. He enjoyed coding and also used his knowledge gained in the courses in this self-driving car project. He values teamwork so much that he refer himself in third person since there is no "I" in "third."  </p>

    <div class="post-content">
        <h3 class="post-title">Josh You</h3>
        <p>Josh is a born and bred Minnesotan, growing up in Lakeville, MN, one of the Twin Cities' fastest-growing suburbs.  Despite his work on this project, Josh enjoys driving and will be a little sad when driving your own car will inevitably be banned 50 years from now, although he will recognize the ban's necessity. Outside of CS, Josh competes on Carleton's debate team, and his hobbies include reading about politics and browsing dank memes.</p>
